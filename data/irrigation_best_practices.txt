COMPREHENSIVE IRRIGATION BEST PRACTICES GUIDE
============================================

1. UNDERSTANDING SOIL MOISTURE LEVELS
-----------------------------------
Optimal soil moisture varies by plant type, but general guidelines include:
- Field Capacity (100%): Soil is fully saturated after drainage
- Optimal Range (50-80%): Most plants thrive in this range
- Stress Point (30-50%): Plants begin showing stress signs
- Wilting Point (Below 30%): Permanent damage may occur

Key Principle: Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.

2. WATERING FREQUENCY GUIDELINES
-------------------------------
Rather than fixed schedules, use these indicators:
- Check soil moisture 2-3 inches below surface
- Morning watering (6-10 AM) reduces evaporation by 30%
- Evening watering can promote fungal growth
- Adjust frequency based on:
  * Temperature (increase 20% for every 10°F above 75°F)
  * Wind speed (increase 10% for winds above 10 mph)
  * Humidity (decrease 15% when humidity exceeds 70%)
  * Growth stage (seedlings need consistent moisture)

3. WATER AMOUNT CALCULATIONS
---------------------------
Base water amount per square foot:
- Clay soil: 0.20 gallons per watering
- Loamy soil: 0.17 gallons per watering  
- Sandy soil: 0.13 gallons per watering

Multiply by:
- Plant size factor: Small (0.5x), Medium (1.0x), Large (1.5x)
- Temperature factor: Cool (<70°F): 0.8x, Moderate (70-85°F): 1.0x, Hot (>85°F): 1.3x
- Growth stage: Seedling (0.5x), Vegetative (1.0x), Flowering (1.2x), Fruiting (1.3x)

4. IRRIGATION METHODS EFFICIENCY
-------------------------------
- Drip irrigation: 90-95% efficiency, best for water conservation
- Soaker hoses: 80-85% efficiency, good for row crops
- Sprinkler systems: 65-75% efficiency, higher evaporation loss
- Hand watering: 50-70% efficiency, inconsistent coverage

5. SEASONAL ADJUSTMENTS
----------------------
Spring (March-May):
- Gradually increase watering as temperatures rise
- Monitor for spring rains to avoid overwatering
- Focus on root establishment for new plants

Summer (June-August):
- Peak water demand period
- Water early morning to reduce evaporation
- Apply mulch to retain moisture (saves 25% water)
- Check containers daily - they dry out faster

Fall (September-November):
- Reduce watering frequency by 30-40%
- Allow slight drying to harden plants for winter
- Deep water trees/shrubs before ground freezes

Winter (December-February):
- Most plants dormant - reduce watering by 70-80%
- Water only when soil is dry and temperature above 40°F
- Evergreens still need occasional water

6. WATER QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------------
- pH range: 6.0-7.0 optimal for most plants
- High salt content (>1000 ppm TDS) requires more frequent watering
- Chlorinated water: Let stand 24 hours before use on sensitive plants
- Rain water: Ideal pH and mineral content for most plants

7. DEFICIT IRRIGATION STRATEGIES
-------------------------------
Strategic under-watering can:
- Improve fruit flavor concentration (tomatoes, grapes)
- Strengthen root systems
- Reduce disease pressure
- Save 20-30% water with minimal yield impact

Implementation:
- Reduce water by 20% during vegetative growth
- Return to full irrigation during flowering
- Reduce by 30% during fruit ripening

8. SIGNS OF IRRIGATION PROBLEMS
------------------------------
Overwatering symptoms:
- Yellowing lower leaves
- Soft, mushy stems
- Fungal growth on soil surface
- Wilting despite moist soil
- Root rot smell

Underwatering symptoms:
- Dry, crispy leaf edges
- Wilting during hottest part of day
- Stunted growth
- Premature flower/fruit drop
- Soil pulling away from container edges

9. ADVANCED MOISTURE MONITORING
-----------------------------
- Tensiometers: Measure soil water tension (optimal: 10-30 centibars)
- Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR): Electronic moisture measurement
- Feel test: Soil forms ball but crumbles when poked (50% moisture)
- Weight method: Container weight indicates moisture level

10. MULCHING FOR WATER CONSERVATION
----------------------------------
Benefits:
- Reduces evaporation by up to 70%
- Moderates soil temperature
- Suppresses weeds that compete for water

Best practices:
- Apply 2-4 inch layer around plants
- Keep mulch 2 inches from plant stems
- Refresh annually as it decomposes
- Organic mulch adds nutrients over time

11. IRRIGATION SCHEDULING FORMULA
--------------------------------
ETc = ETo × Kc

Where:
- ETc = Crop evapotranspiration (water need)
- ETo = Reference evapotranspiration (weather-based)
- Kc = Crop coefficient (varies by plant and growth stage)

Example crop coefficients:
- Lettuce: 0.4 (initial) → 1.0 (mid-season)
- Tomatoes: 0.6 (initial) → 1.15 (mid-season) → 0.8 (late season)
- Grass: 0.8-0.85 (consistent)

12. SMART IRRIGATION TRIGGERS
----------------------------
Automate irrigation when:
- Soil moisture drops below plant-specific threshold
- No rain forecast within 24 hours
- Temperature exceeds daily maximum threshold
- Wind speed is below 15 mph (reduces drift)
- Time is within optimal window (dawn/early morning)

13. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
------------------------
Problem: Uneven water distribution
Solution: Check for clogged emitters, adjust pressure, level soil

Problem: Frequent cycling needed
Solution: Improve soil structure with compost, check for hardpan layer

Problem: High water bills
Solution: Check for leaks, adjust schedule seasonally, consider drip conversion

Problem: Plants wilt despite adequate moisture
Solution: Check for root damage, disease, or salt buildup

14. WATER CONSERVATION TIPS
--------------------------
- Group plants by water needs (hydrozoning)
- Use drought-tolerant varieties when possible
- Collect rainwater (can save 30-50% on irrigation)
- Fix leaks immediately (1 drip/second = 3,000 gallons/year)
- Adjust sprinklers to avoid hardscapes
- Install smart controllers with weather adjustment

15. EMERGENCY DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
-------------------------------
Priority watering during restrictions:
1. Young trees and shrubs (less than 2 years)
2. Vegetable gardens and fruit trees
3. High-value perennials
4. Established trees
5. Lawn areas (lowest priority)

Survival watering: Apply 25% of normal amount to keep plants alive.
